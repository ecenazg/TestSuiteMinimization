 * A stopping condition defines the budget allocated to a search algorithm. If the budget is exhausted, the search must stop.
 * Some algorithms may choose to stop earlier, e.g., when the best solution has been found or solutions are no longer improving.

 * The search algorithm can then notify the registered observers of certain events, such as fitness evaluations.
